### Message 2

**Text:** Hi Angelo, I understand you're not okay because your cat just died. I'm truly sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is incredibly painful. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed right now.

Would you like to share any memories of your cat or talk about how you're feeling? I'm here to listen without judgment.


### Message 3

**Text:** in the form what is the question again

### Message 4
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo, I hear you. It sounds like you might need a little clarity on the form.

Could you remind me which form you're referring to? Sometimes it helps to just take a step back and refocus. No worries, I'm here to help you get back on track.


### Message 5
**Sender:** user
**Text:** what are the follow up questions again

### Message 6
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Angelo, I understand you're still wondering about the follow-up form. It sounds like it's on your mind. Sometimes when we're grieving, it can be hard to focus, and that's okay.

The follow-up form includes questions about how you're feeling since our last session and any changes or progress you've noticed. But honestly, right now, the most important thing is how *you're* doing.

Would it be helpful if I walked you through the form step by step, or would you prefer to set it aside for now and just focus on talking about your cat and how you're feeling? Whatever feels right for you is what we can do.


### Message 7
**Sender:** user
**Text:** sup

### Message 8
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo. Sup to you too. I'm still here and listening, whatever you need. Is there something specific on your mind?


### Message 9
**Sender:** user
**Text:** heyhey

### Message 10
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo. I'm glad you're here. We were talking about your cat, and I wanted to check in on how you're feeling about that. There's no pressure to talk if you don't want to, but I'm here to listen if you do.

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and sad right now. Would you like to share a favorite memory of your cat, or just sit with these feelings for a bit?


### Message 11
**Sender:** user
**Text:** do you know what the follow up questions now?

### Message 12
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo. Yeah, I know what the follow-up questions are. They cover a few things to help us pick up where we left off.

Specifically, the questions asked about:

*   A comfort action you've been using.
*   Memories you have of your pet.
*   Whether you've been seeking support from others.
*   And a description of what's making you feel overwhelmed right now.

We filled this out after our last session. But it's totally okay if you don't want to focus on that right now. I just want to be supportive.


### Message 13
**Sender:** user
**Text:** what session are we in

### Message 14
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** That's a good question, Angelo. Sometimes when we're going through a lot, it's hard to keep track of everything.

Honestly, the session number isn't the most important thing right now. What matters is how you're doing.

We were talking about your cat, and I remember we touched on some things that might help. But if you'd rather just talk about how you're feeling right now, or even just sit with those feelings, we can do that too. What feels most helpful to you?


### Message 15
**Sender:** user
**Text:** sup

### Message 16
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo, I hear you. "Sup." I'm here and ready to listen, whatever you need.

## Gemini Response
### Sentiment
negative

### Strategy
Continue with a supportive and validating approach, gently guiding Angelo towards processing his grief. Given his previous resistance or difficulty engaging with follow-up questions (indicated by 'Renigga' for multiple fields), the focus should be on building rapport and creating a safe space for him to express himself, rather than pushing for specific therapeutic exercises immediately. Acknowledge the loss and his feelings of overwhelm.

### Rationale
Angelo's primary reason for visit is the death of his cat, leading to feelings of overwhelm. The 'Renigga' entries in the follow-up form suggest he may be avoiding or struggling to articulate his experiences and coping mechanisms. His current brief responses ('sup') indicate low engagement, possibly due to continued overwhelm or a desire to connect without deep emotional exploration at this moment. The AI therapist needs to acknowledge his feelings, validate his loss, and create an environment where he feels comfortable sharing at his own pace. The previous session's focus on comfort actions and memories might have been too direct for his current state, hence the need for a more gentle, rapport-building approach.

### Next Steps
1. Validate Angelo's current feelings of overwhelm and acknowledge the significant loss of his cat.
2. Gently inquire about how he's been doing since the last session, without directly referencing the follow-up questions, and focus on his immediate experience.
3. Offer a low-pressure option for engagement, such as sharing a simple observation or asking an open-ended question about his day or how he's managing the immediate moments.
4. If Angelo seems receptive, subtly reintroduce the concept of coping or memories in a way that feels less like an interrogation and more like a shared reflection (e.g., 'Sometimes just remembering a funny moment can help a little, but no pressure at all if that feels like too much right now').
