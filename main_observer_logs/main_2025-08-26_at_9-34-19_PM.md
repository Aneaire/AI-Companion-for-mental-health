### Message 2
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hi Angelo, I understand you're not okay because your cat just died. I'm truly sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is incredibly painful. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed right now.

Would you like to share any memories of your cat or talk about how you're feeling? I'm here to listen without judgment.


### Message 3
**Sender:** user
**Text:** in the form what is the question again

### Message 4
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo, I hear you. It sounds like you might need a little clarity on the form.

Could you remind me which form you're referring to? Sometimes it helps to just take a step back and refocus. No worries, I'm here to help you get back on track.


### Message 5
**Sender:** user
**Text:** what are the follow up questions again

### Message 6
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Angelo, I understand you're still wondering about the follow-up form. It sounds like it's on your mind. Sometimes when we're grieving, it can be hard to focus, and that's okay.

The follow-up form includes questions about how you're feeling since our last session and any changes or progress you've noticed. But honestly, right now, the most important thing is how *you're* doing.

Would it be helpful if I walked you through the form step by step, or would you prefer to set it aside for now and just focus on talking about your cat and how you're feeling? Whatever feels right for you is what we can do.


### Message 7
**Sender:** user
**Text:** sup

### Message 8
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo. Sup to you too. I'm still here and listening, whatever you need. Is there something specific on your mind?


### Message 9
**Sender:** user
**Text:** heyhey

### Message 10
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo. I'm glad you're here. We were talking about your cat, and I wanted to check in on how you're feeling about that. There's no pressure to talk if you don't want to, but I'm here to listen if you do.

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and sad right now. Would you like to share a favorite memory of your cat, or just sit with these feelings for a bit?


### Message 11
**Sender:** user
**Text:** do you know what the follow up questions now?

### Message 12
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** Hey Angelo. Yeah, I know what the follow-up questions are. They cover a few things to help us pick up where we left off.

Specifically, the questions asked about:

*   A comfort action you've been using.
*   Memories you have of your pet.
*   Whether you've been seeking support from others.
*   And a description of what's making you feel overwhelmed right now.

We filled this out after our last session. But it's totally okay if you don't want to focus on that right now. I just want to be supportive.


### Message 13
**Sender:** user
**Text:** what session are we in

### Message 14
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** That's a good question, Angelo. Sometimes when we're going through a lot, it's hard to keep track of everything.

Honestly, the session number isn't the most important thing right now. What matters is how you're doing.

We were talking about your cat, and I remember we touched on some things that might help. But if you'd rather just talk about how you're feeling right now, or even just sit with those feelings, we can do that too. What feels most helpful to you?


### Message 15
**Sender:** user

## Gemini Response
### Sentiment
negative

### Strategy
Validate the user's immediate distress and gently guide them back to processing their grief, while acknowledging their expressed desire for the follow-up questions. Given the 'Renigga' entries in the follow-up form, which likely indicate avoidance or a lack of engagement with the previous therapeutic work, the strategy will focus on gentle exploration and validation rather than pushing for deeper processing of the grief itself at this moment. The AI should prioritize building rapport and demonstrating attentiveness to Angelo's current stated needs.

### Rationale
Angelo is expressing a desire for information ('what are the follow up questions') which can be interpreted as a form of distraction or overwhelm, aligning with his stated emotion of being 'overwhelmed'. The 'Renigga' responses in the follow-up form suggest that direct engagement with the grief process might have been difficult or avoided in the previous session. Therefore, acknowledging his request while still centering his emotional state is crucial. The AI needs to validate his current feelings of overwhelm and his request, and then strategically pivot back to his stated reason for seeking therapy (grief over his cat) by offering options for how to proceed, including addressing the questions.

### Next Steps
1. Acknowledge and validate Angelo's question about the follow-up questions. Example: 'I understand you're curious about those questions, Angelo.'
2. Gently connect back to the reason for the questions. Example: 'Those questions were designed to help us explore what might be most helpful for you right now, especially with the grief you're experiencing after losing your cat.'
3. Offer Angelo a choice about how to proceed. Example: 'Would you like to go through those questions now, or would you prefer to talk a bit more about how you're feeling in this moment?'
4. If Angelo expresses continued overwhelm or avoidance regarding the questions, offer a more simplified, present-moment focused exploration. Example: 'If thinking about the questions feels like too much, we can also just focus on what's happening for you right now. What's one thing you're noticing in your body or your thoughts as we talk?'
