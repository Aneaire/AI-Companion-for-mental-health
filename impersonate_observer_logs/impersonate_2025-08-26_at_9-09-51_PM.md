**Sender:** user
**Text:** Hi
. Yeah, thanks for seeing me. I... I don't even know where to start,
 really. It's just a lot right now.

**Text:** Hi Angelo, thanks for coming in. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's completely understandable when you're dealing with a lot. It's okay not to know where to start.

Can you tell me a little more about what feels like "a lot" for you at the moment? We can take this one step at a time.

### Message 3

**Text:** Hi
, thanks for seeing me. Yeah, "overwhelmed" is… it
’s definitely the word. It’s just… this capstone project. It’s supposed to be the big finale of my degree, you know? And I’m just drowning in it. It feels like everyone else is miles
 ahead, and I’m just… stuck.
I mean, it’s computer science, so it’s already pretty demanding, but this project is supposed to showcase everything we’ve learned. And I’m just constantly looking around
 and seeing what everyone else is doing, especially this guy, Marco. He’s just… he’s incredible. His code is so elegant, and his ideas are so far out there, but they actually work. And then I look
 at my own stuff, and it feels so… basic. Like I’m fumbling around in the dark while he’s building a skyscraper.
It’s making it really hard to even want to work on it, you know? Like
, what’s the point if it’s never going to be as good as his? And my parents, they’re always asking about it, expecting me to land some amazing job offer right after graduation. And this project is like
… the ticket. But right now, it feels more like a dead end. I’m not sleeping well, and even when I try to focus, my mind just drifts to all the ways I’m falling short. It’s…
 a lot.

### Message 4

**Text:** Hi there, thanks for sharing all of that with me. It sounds incredibly tough right now, Angelo, and I really hear how overwhelmed and stuck you're feeling with this capstone project. It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're facing something so significant, especially when you feel like you're comparing yourself to others.

It's very common to look at someone like Marco and feel like they're miles ahead, especially in a field like computer science. We often only see the polished final product, not the hours of struggle and debugging that go into it. Everyone has their own unique journey and challenges, even if they don't seem obvious from the outside.

What you're experiencing – that feeling of inadequacy and the pressure from your parents – must be really weighing on you, affecting your sleep and focus. It makes complete sense that it would make it hard to even start.

Angelo, what's one tiny step, no matter how small, that you think you could manage to take on your project today that might feel a little less daunting? Or perhaps, would it be helpful to think about a short break you could take to do something you enjoy, just to help reset your mind?

### Message 5
**Sender:** user
**Text:** Yeah
, it… it does feel a bit better, actually, just saying it out
 loud. The pressure to just… power through, like you said, it’s like a constant hum in the background. And you’re right, comparing myself to Marco, or anyone, really, it’s just this endless spiral
 of “I’m not good enough.” It’s exhausting.
The bug… I mean, it feels like this massive, insurmountable wall right now. But breaking it down, just reading the documentation with no expectation of *fixing* it,
 just… understanding it. That feels… doable. And the walk, I don't know, just the thought of getting some fresh air and not staring at a screen for a bit makes my shoulders relax a little. It’s like, maybe
 I *can* do something that doesn’t involve me feeling like a failure. So yeah, it feels… a little hopeful, I guess.


## Initial Form Data

- **Preferred Name:** Angelo Santiago
- **Current Emotions:** Not provided
- **Reason for Visit:** I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and burnt out by my final year capstone project. I'm constantly comparing my work to my classmates', especially this one guy, Marco, who seems effortlessly brilliant. It makes me feel inadequate and like my own efforts aren't good enough, no matter how much time I put in. I'm losing sleep, my motivation is plummeting, and I just can't shake this feeling of dread about it.
- **Support Type:** Not provided
- **Additional Context:** Not provided


## Gemini Response
### Sentiment
positive

### Strategy
Acknowledge the user's renewed sense of hope and validate the small, actionable steps they've identified. Gently encourage them to choose one of those steps and provide supportive framing for it. Continue to normalize their feelings of comparison and pressure.

### Rationale
Angelo is expressing a shift towards feeling hopeful, recognizing the value of small, manageable actions and taking a break. The AI should capitalize on this positive momentum by reinforcing these identified steps and continuing to build on the foundation of understanding and validation. The goal is to empower Angelo to take agency and experience a small win, thereby reducing the 'overwhelmed' feeling and combating the 'not good enough' narrative. Staying in character means maintaining the empathetic, supportive, and guiding tone of a therapist or counselor.

### Next Steps
1. Affirm Angelo's feeling of hope and acknowledge that articulating these small steps is progress.
2. Ask which of the two identified steps (reading documentation or taking a walk) feels most accessible or appealing *right now*.
3. Frame the chosen action as a positive step towards managing his project and well-being, rather than a way to 'catch up' or 'compete'.
4. Gently reiterate that his feelings of comparison are understandable, but emphasize that focusing on his own process is key.
