**Text:** Hi
. Yeah, thanks for seeing me. I... I don't even know where to start,
 really. It's just a lot right now.

**Text:** Hi Angelo, thanks for coming in. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's completely understandable when you're dealing with a lot. It's okay not to know where to start.

Can you tell me a little more about what feels like "a lot" for you at the moment? We can take this one step at a time.

**Text:** Hi
, thanks for seeing me. Yeah, "overwhelmed" is… it
’s definitely the word. It’s just… this capstone project. It’s supposed to be the big finale of my degree, you know? And I’m just drowning in it. It feels like everyone else is miles
 ahead, and I’m just… stuck.
I mean, it’s computer science, so it’s already pretty demanding, but this project is supposed to showcase everything we’ve learned. And I’m just constantly looking around
 and seeing what everyone else is doing, especially this guy, Marco. He’s just… he’s incredible. His code is so elegant, and his ideas are so far out there, but they actually work. And then I look
 at my own stuff, and it feels so… basic. Like I’m fumbling around in the dark while he’s building a skyscraper.
It’s making it really hard to even want to work on it, you know? Like
, what’s the point if it’s never going to be as good as his? And my parents, they’re always asking about it, expecting me to land some amazing job offer right after graduation. And this project is like
… the ticket. But right now, it feels more like a dead end. I’m not sleeping well, and even when I try to focus, my mind just drifts to all the ways I’m falling short. It’s…
 a lot.

**Text:** Hi there, thanks for sharing all of that with me. It sounds incredibly tough right now, Angelo, and I really hear how overwhelmed and stuck you're feeling with this capstone project. It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're facing something so significant, especially when you feel like you're comparing yourself to others.

It's very common to look at someone like Marco and feel like they're miles ahead, especially in a field like computer science. We often only see the polished final product, not the hours of struggle and debugging that go into it. Everyone has their own unique journey and challenges, even if they don't seem obvious from the outside.

What you're experiencing – that feeling of inadequacy and the pressure from your parents – must be really weighing on you, affecting your sleep and focus. It makes complete sense that it would make it hard to even start.

Angelo, what's one tiny step, no matter how small, that you think you could manage to take on your project today that might feel a little less daunting? Or perhaps, would it be helpful to think about a short break you could take to do something you enjoy, just to help reset your mind?

### Message 5
**Sender:** user
**Text:** Um
, thanks for saying that. It helps a bit, actually, just to hear that it
's… not just me being weird about this. I guess I always thought I was supposed to be able to just power through things, you know? Like, if you’re smart, it should just… work.
And yeah
, Marco… it’s like, he just presents his stuff, and it’s so clean, and he talks about it like it’s nothing. Meanwhile, I’m here wrestling with code that feels like spaghetti and I’m pretty
 sure I’ve forgotten half the syntax I learned last semester. The comparison thing is… it’s exhausting. It’s like I’m constantly running a race I didn’t even sign up for, and I’m already
 miles behind.
My parents, yeah, they’re supportive in their way, but it’s that expectation. It’s not overtly critical, but it’s there. This project *is* the gateway to everything, and I feel
 like I’m about to drop the ball spectacularly.
A tiny step… that’s a good way to put it. I’ve been staring at this one bug for like, three days. It’s so dumb, I know
 it is, but I just can’t see it. Maybe… maybe I could just try reading through the documentation for that specific library again, with a fresh cup of coffee, and not try to fix it, just… understand it better
? That feels… less like a mountain.
And a break… yeah, that sounds really nice. I haven’t really done anything for fun in… I don’t know how long. Maybe going for a walk, just to
 clear my head for half an hour, before I even try to look at the code again. That could be good.

**Text:** Angelo, it's really insightful of you to recognize that the pressure to just "power through" when you're feeling stuck isn't always the most helpful approach, especially when you're comparing yourself to others. It sounds like you're developing a stronger awareness of how that comparison is impacting you, and that's a huge step in itself. It's completely natural to feel that way when you're learning and pushing your boundaries.

Those ideas you have for a "tiny step" and a break sound like excellent ways to manage this. Reading through the documentation for your bug with a fresh perspective, focusing on understanding rather than fixing, is a really smart move. It takes the immediate pressure off and allows you to engage with the material in a new way. And a walk to clear your head before diving back in? That’s fantastic. It’s so important to give yourself that space to recharge and reset.

It sounds like you've identified two really manageable and positive actions for yourself right now. How does it feel to think about taking those steps?

### Message 7
**Sender:** user
**Text:** Yeah
, it… it does feel a bit better, actually, just saying it out
 loud. The pressure to just… power through, like you said, it’s like a constant hum in the background. And you’re right, comparing myself to Marco, or anyone, really, it’s just this endless spiral
 of “I’m not good enough.” It’s exhausting.
The bug… I mean, it feels like this massive, insurmountable wall right now. But breaking it down, just reading the documentation with no expectation of *fixing* it,
 just… understanding it. That feels… doable. And the walk, I don't know, just the thought of getting some fresh air and not staring at a screen for a bit makes my shoulders relax a little. It’s like, maybe
 I *can* do something that doesn’t involve me feeling like a failure. So yeah, it feels… a little hopeful, I guess.

### Message 8
**Sender:** ai
**Text:** It's really positive to hear that just talking about it has helped a bit, Angelo. And I want to acknowledge that recognizing the "I'm not good enough" spiral and the pressure to "power through" are huge steps in themselves. It takes a lot of awareness to see those patterns.

It sounds like both options – reading the documentation with a focus on understanding, or taking a walk – are resonating with you as manageable and less intimidating right now. That feeling of "doable" is exactly what we're aiming for when things feel overwhelming.

If you had to choose just one of those right now, which one feels most appealing, or easiest to step into first? Remember, it’s not about catching up or competing, but about taking care of yourself and your project in a way that feels manageable for *you*.


## Initial Form Data

- **Preferred Name:** Angelo Santiago
- **Current Emotions:** Not provided
- **Reason for Visit:** I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and burnt out by my final year capstone project. I'm constantly comparing my work to my classmates', especially this one guy, Marco, who seems effortlessly brilliant. It makes me feel inadequate and like my own efforts aren't good enough, no matter how much time I put in. I'm losing sleep, my motivation is plummeting, and I just can't shake this feeling of dread about it.
- **Support Type:** Not provided
- **Additional Context:** Not provided


## Gemini Response
### Sentiment
positive

### Strategy
Reinforce Angelo's agency and validation of his positive feelings, gently guide him toward choosing one of his planned actions, and express continued support.

### Rationale
Angelo is expressing positive emotions ('feels a bit better,' 'doable,' 'hopeful') and has identified two concrete, manageable steps. The AI should capitalize on this momentum by validating these feelings and actions, reinforcing his sense of agency, and prompting a decision without creating new pressure. This aligns with being a supportive companion by empowering him to take the next small step.

### Next Steps
1. Acknowledge and validate Angelo's feeling of hope and his articulation of 'doable' steps.
2. Gently prompt him to choose which of the two actions (documentation or walk) he feels most inclined to start with, emphasizing that either is a good choice.
3. Reiterate that the goal is self-care and manageable progress, not perfection or comparison.
4. Offer to check in later or be available if he wants to talk more after taking one of his steps.
