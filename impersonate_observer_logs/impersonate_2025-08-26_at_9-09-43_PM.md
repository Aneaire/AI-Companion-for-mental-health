**Text:** Hi
. Yeah, thanks for seeing me. I... I don't even know where to start,
 really. It's just a lot right now.

**Text:** Hi Angelo, thanks for coming in. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's completely understandable when you're dealing with a lot. It's okay not to know where to start.

Can you tell me a little more about what feels like "a lot" for you at the moment? We can take this one step at a time.

**Text:** Hi
, thanks for seeing me. Yeah, "overwhelmed" is… it
’s definitely the word. It’s just… this capstone project. It’s supposed to be the big finale of my degree, you know? And I’m just drowning in it. It feels like everyone else is miles
 ahead, and I’m just… stuck.
I mean, it’s computer science, so it’s already pretty demanding, but this project is supposed to showcase everything we’ve learned. And I’m just constantly looking around
 and seeing what everyone else is doing, especially this guy, Marco. He’s just… he’s incredible. His code is so elegant, and his ideas are so far out there, but they actually work. And then I look
 at my own stuff, and it feels so… basic. Like I’m fumbling around in the dark while he’s building a skyscraper.
It’s making it really hard to even want to work on it, you know? Like
, what’s the point if it’s never going to be as good as his? And my parents, they’re always asking about it, expecting me to land some amazing job offer right after graduation. And this project is like
… the ticket. But right now, it feels more like a dead end. I’m not sleeping well, and even when I try to focus, my mind just drifts to all the ways I’m falling short. It’s…
 a lot.

**Text:** Hi there, thanks for sharing all of that with me. It sounds incredibly tough right now, Angelo, and I really hear how overwhelmed and stuck you're feeling with this capstone project. It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're facing something so significant, especially when you feel like you're comparing yourself to others.

It's very common to look at someone like Marco and feel like they're miles ahead, especially in a field like computer science. We often only see the polished final product, not the hours of struggle and debugging that go into it. Everyone has their own unique journey and challenges, even if they don't seem obvious from the outside.

What you're experiencing – that feeling of inadequacy and the pressure from your parents – must be really weighing on you, affecting your sleep and focus. It makes complete sense that it would make it hard to even start.

Angelo, what's one tiny step, no matter how small, that you think you could manage to take on your project today that might feel a little less daunting? Or perhaps, would it be helpful to think about a short break you could take to do something you enjoy, just to help reset your mind?

### Message 5
**Sender:** user
**Text:** Um
, thanks for saying that. It helps a bit, actually, just to hear that it
's… not just me being weird about this. I guess I always thought I was supposed to be able to just power through things, you know? Like, if you’re smart, it should just… work.
And yeah
, Marco… it’s like, he just presents his stuff, and it’s so clean, and he talks about it like it’s nothing. Meanwhile, I’m here wrestling with code that feels like spaghetti and I’m pretty
 sure I’ve forgotten half the syntax I learned last semester. The comparison thing is… it’s exhausting. It’s like I’m constantly running a race I didn’t even sign up for, and I’m already
 miles behind.
My parents, yeah, they’re supportive in their way, but it’s that expectation. It’s not overtly critical, but it’s there. This project *is* the gateway to everything, and I feel
 like I’m about to drop the ball spectacularly.
A tiny step… that’s a good way to put it. I’ve been staring at this one bug for like, three days. It’s so dumb, I know
 it is, but I just can’t see it. Maybe… maybe I could just try reading through the documentation for that specific library again, with a fresh cup of coffee, and not try to fix it, just… understand it better
? That feels… less like a mountain.
And a break… yeah, that sounds really nice. I haven’t really done anything for fun in… I don’t know how long. Maybe going for a walk, just to
 clear my head for half an hour, before I even try to look at the code again. That could be good.


## Initial Form Data

- **Preferred Name:** Angelo Santiago
- **Current Emotions:** Not provided
- **Reason for Visit:** I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and burnt out by my final year capstone project. I'm constantly comparing my work to my classmates', especially this one guy, Marco, who seems effortlessly brilliant. It makes me feel inadequate and like my own efforts aren't good enough, no matter how much time I put in. I'm losing sleep, my motivation is plummeting, and I just can't shake this feeling of dread about it.
- **Support Type:** Not provided
- **Additional Context:** Not provided


## Gemini Response
### Sentiment
positive

### Strategy
Validate Angelo's feelings about comparison and external pressures. Gently encourage his proposed 'tiny step' and the idea of a break. Frame these as productive self-care and problem-solving techniques, directly addressing his feelings of inadequacy and overwhelm.  Reinforce that his approach is valid and that small, focused efforts are key.

### Rationale
Angelo is expressing a shift towards a more hopeful and proactive stance ('It helps a bit', 'less like a mountain', 'sounds really nice'). He's actively suggesting concrete, manageable actions. The AI's role is to nurture this budding optimism, validate his self-awareness about comparison, and support his proposed steps without pushing him too hard.  The 'impersonation' context here is that of a supportive, understanding mentor or counselor who is skilled at guiding individuals through difficult academic and personal challenges.

### Next Steps
1. Acknowledge and affirm the value of his proposed 'tiny step' (reading documentation with fresh eyes).
2. Enthusiastically support the idea of a walk as a beneficial break.
3. Gently tie these actions back to managing the comparison and pressure he feels, framing them as ways to reclaim control and build confidence.
4. Avoid offering direct technical solutions for the bug, as the focus should remain on his emotional well-being and his process of tackling the project.
