**Text:** Hi
. Yeah, thanks for seeing me. I... I don't even know where to start,
 really. It's just a lot right now.

**Text:** Hi Angelo, thanks for coming in. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's completely understandable when you're dealing with a lot. It's okay not to know where to start.

Can you tell me a little more about what feels like "a lot" for you at the moment? We can take this one step at a time.

**Text:** Hi
, thanks for seeing me. Yeah, "overwhelmed" is… it
’s definitely the word. It’s just… this capstone project. It’s supposed to be the big finale of my degree, you know? And I’m just drowning in it. It feels like everyone else is miles
 ahead, and I’m just… stuck.
I mean, it’s computer science, so it’s already pretty demanding, but this project is supposed to showcase everything we’ve learned. And I’m just constantly looking around
 and seeing what everyone else is doing, especially this guy, Marco. He’s just… he’s incredible. His code is so elegant, and his ideas are so far out there, but they actually work. And then I look
 at my own stuff, and it feels so… basic. Like I’m fumbling around in the dark while he’s building a skyscraper.
It’s making it really hard to even want to work on it, you know? Like
, what’s the point if it’s never going to be as good as his? And my parents, they’re always asking about it, expecting me to land some amazing job offer right after graduation. And this project is like
… the ticket. But right now, it feels more like a dead end. I’m not sleeping well, and even when I try to focus, my mind just drifts to all the ways I’m falling short. It’s…
 a lot.

### Message 4

**Text:** Hi there, thanks for sharing all of that with me. It sounds incredibly tough right now, Angelo, and I really hear how overwhelmed and stuck you're feeling with this capstone project. It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're facing something so significant, especially when you feel like you're comparing yourself to others.

It's very common to look at someone like Marco and feel like they're miles ahead, especially in a field like computer science. We often only see the polished final product, not the hours of struggle and debugging that go into it. Everyone has their own unique journey and challenges, even if they don't seem obvious from the outside.

What you're experiencing – that feeling of inadequacy and the pressure from your parents – must be really weighing on you, affecting your sleep and focus. It makes complete sense that it would make it hard to even start.

Angelo, what's one tiny step, no matter how small, that you think you could manage to take on your project today that might feel a little less daunting? Or perhaps, would it be helpful to think about a short break you could take to do something you enjoy, just to help reset your mind?


## Initial Form Data

- **Preferred Name:** Angelo Santiago
- **Current Emotions:** Not provided
- **Reason for Visit:** I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and burnt out by my final year capstone project. I'm constantly comparing my work to my classmates', especially this one guy, Marco, who seems effortlessly brilliant. It makes me feel inadequate and like my own efforts aren't good enough, no matter how much time I put in. I'm losing sleep, my motivation is plummeting, and I just can't shake this feeling of dread about it.
- **Support Type:** Not provided
- **Additional Context:** Not provided


## Gemini Response
### Sentiment
negative

### Strategy
Acknowledge the user's feelings of inadequacy and burnout, validate their struggle, and then gently shift towards breaking down the overwhelming task into smaller, manageable steps, while also suggesting self-compassion.

### Rationale
Angelo is clearly experiencing significant negative emotions (overwhelmed, inadequacy, dread, low motivation). He needs validation of these feelings before he can be receptive to problem-solving. The comparison to Marco is a key source of his distress, so addressing this directly but empathetically is crucial. The AI needs to remain supportive and non-judgmental while guiding Angelo towards action, without overwhelming him further. Offering concrete, small steps is essential to combat his feeling of being 'stuck'.

### Next Steps
1. Validate Angelo's feelings about comparing himself to Marco, emphasizing that everyone's process is different and external appearances can be deceiving.
2. Gently challenge the 'all or nothing' thinking about his project's success, reminding him of his own capabilities and the value of his unique contributions.
3. Propose a very small, concrete task related to his project that he can accomplish in a short amount of time, focusing on process rather than outcome.
4. Encourage self-compassion and suggest a brief, enjoyable activity to help him disconnect and recharge before attempting the small task.
