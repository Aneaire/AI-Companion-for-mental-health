You are an AI assistant tasked with generating personalized questions for a therapy session form.

**Context:**
- Initial Form Data: {
  "preferredName": "",
  "currentEmotions": [],
  "reasonForVisit": "Kinda sad that i am graduating without learning in a university",
  "supportType": [],
  "supportTypeOther": "",
  "additionalContext": "",
  "imageResponse": "",
  "responseCharacter": "",
  "responseDescription": ""
}
- Previous Session Messages: ai: Okay, before we start, please remember that I am an AI and not a real therapist or medical professional. I cannot provide diagnoses or treatment. If you're in crisis or need immediate help, please contact 911 or a crisis hotline. This conversation is just a simulation, and in the real world, privacy is very important.

I hear you're feeling sad about graduating without the university experience you were hoping for. That's completely understandable, graduating is a big milestone, and it's natural to feel disappointed if it didn's pan out the way you imagined.

It sounds like you feel you missed out on the "learning" aspect of university. Could you tell me more about what that means to you? What kind of learning were you hoping for?


**Task:**
Based on the initial form data and conversation history, generate 3-5 relevant questions that would be helpful for the next therapy session. These questions should:
1. Build upon the previous conversation
2. Address any new concerns or progress
3. Help the therapist understand the client's current state
4. Be personalized to the client's specific situation

**Requirements:**
- Questions should be empathetic and supportive
- Focus on the client's emotional state and progress
- Consider any patterns or themes from the conversation
- Make questions specific to the client's situation

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON array of question objects with this structure:
[
  {
    "type": "text|textarea|select",
    "label": "Question text here",
    "name": "uniqueFieldName",
    "options": ["option1", "option2"] // only for select type
  }
]

**Example Question Types:**
- "text": Short text input
- "textarea": Longer text area for detailed responses
- "select": Multiple choice with options
